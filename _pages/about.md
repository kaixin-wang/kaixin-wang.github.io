Welcome to Kaixin's Website!

I'm a senior undergraduate at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), majoring in Statistics and Applied Mathematics.

My interests of study are Statistics, Data Science and Computer Science. 

My research interests are in machine learning (e.g., supervised learning), and deep learning (e.g., convolutional network, reinforcement study, image recognition and natural language processing).
